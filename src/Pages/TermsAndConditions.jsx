          All payments must be made exclusively through Razorpay using the

        <p className="mt-2">
          Payments made outside the Razorpay payment gateway (e.g., direct UPI
          or bank transfers) are strongly discouraged. Non-gateway payments will
          be allowed only with prior written agreement and will require manual
          processing, which may result in delays or complications in
          reconciliation.{" "}
          <strong>Administrative charges will apply for such payments</strong>,
          though the actual amount will depend on various factors related to the
          transaction, including payment type, reconciliation time, and
          transaction complexity.

          the balance is cleared. Payments are considered complete only when
          successfully processed through Razorpay or manually reconciled (in the
          case of an approved exception).
